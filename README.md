## Unit Tests for Coin Purse

The `tests` directory contains JUnit tests for classes
in the Polymorphic Purse lab.

You need the JUnit 4 libraries (JARs) to run these tests.
BlueJ and Eclipse include JUnit 4.  IntelliJ IDEA will
download the JUnit files when it detects
a project that needs them (it prompts you for permission).
For VS Code you need to install JUnit yourself, then
add the JARs as project dependencies.

`test` is the standard name for a folder containing test
source code.  Its not a package name. 
So, `test/coinpurse/CoinTest.java` is in package `coinpurse`.

Eclipse, IDEA, and NetBeans support projects with separate 
folders for application source and test source, but BlueJ does not.
If you are using BlueJ you will need to copy the test classes
into your BlueJ project.


### How to Run

You can run each test separately (as a JUnit test suite)
or run the TestRunner class as an ordinary Java "main" class.

The [lab2-test][lab2-test] repository has instructions for 
using JUnit with BlueJ and VS Code.
