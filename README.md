## Unit Tests for Coin Purse

The `tests` directory contains JUnit tests for classes
in the Polymorphic Coin Purse lab.

You need JUnit 4 libraries (JARs) to run these tests.
BlueJ and Eclipse include JUnit 4.  IntelliJ IDEA will
automatically download the JUnit files when it detects
a project that needs them (it prompts you first).
For VS Code you need to install JUnit yourself, then
add the JARs to the project dependencies.

"`test`" is the standard name for a folder containing test
source code.  Its not a package name.  Eclipse, IDEA, and
NetBeans support projects with separate folders for 
application source and test source, but BlueJ does not.
So, if you are using BlueJ you'll need to copy the test classes
into your BlueJ project.
